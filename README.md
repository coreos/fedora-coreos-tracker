Welcome to the Fedora CoreOS issue tracker. This tracker will be used
to discuss new features for Fedora CoreOS and also important bugs that
are affecting the project. Tickets with the `meeting` label will be
taken as agenda items during the meetings. This repo is to be used primarily
for development purposes. If you are a user and have questions please use
the [forum or the mailing list](#communication-channels-for-fedora-coreos).

# Fedora CoreOS Working Group

Fedora CoreOS is an automatically updating, minimal, monolithic,
container-focused operating system, designed for clusters but also
operable standalone, optimized for Kubernetes but also great without
it. It aims to combine the best of both CoreOS Container Linux and
Fedora Atomic Host, integrating technology like Ignition from Container
Linux with rpm-ostree and SELinux hardening from Project Atomic. Its
goal is to provide the best container host to run containerized workloads
securely and at scale.

The Fedora CoreOS Working Group works to bring together the various
technologies and produce Fedora CoreOS.
