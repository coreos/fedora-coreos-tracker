[cverna] What is our messaging to other conferences?
[jbrooks] We can produce a slide deck that can be reused/customized for talks/presentation
[walters] Fedora very RPM-centric; would love to push us towards more pure containers
[travier] tried to run Fedora images for containerizing Matrix and hit issues; having trusted container images outside Dockerhub would be great
[cglombek] not producing enough Fedora containers; maintaining containers in Fedora has high requirements (i.e. must be packagers). also facing problem of where to publish community operators in OKD space.
[jbrooks/dmabe] identified a problem that we don't have the applications people want in our sphere of control (i.e don't have trusted containers for all apps).  how can we improve the Fedora container story?
[cverna] need to have a better idea of who we are targeting with our content
[mperez] have connections with linux unplugged, can get FCOS discussed there; interested in producing more video content for communities (i.e. https://ceph.io/community/meetings/).  working on templates for hosting this style of content.
[mnordin] FCOS has access to all the Fedora community tools above; willing to help move tickets along in various community resources
[sumantro] Fedora Classrooms would be a good outreach point
[sumantro] Adding FCOS to https://whatcanidoforfedora.org/ will be great.
[vipul] A bit different thing: opening a few GSoC/Outreachy projects can also bring a lot of eyes on the project. They are often not the best but it can help and also identify close all gaps in "How can I get started with FCOS" documentation
[dmabe/mperez] measuring stats for MLs, forums, GH tracker may be informative
[mnordin] would recommend starting with a user survey to gather a baseline from where to start from
[mperez] example survey - https://tracker.ceph.com/attachments/download/5323/Ceph%20User%20Survey%202020%20(3).pdf
