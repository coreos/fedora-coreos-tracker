# Fedora CoreOS metadata

Fedora CoreOS artifacts and streams are described by metadata objects, in the form of JSON documents.
This allows the general audience to consume releases and updates in a machine-friendly way.

The following types of metadata exist:
 * stream metadata
 * updates metadata
 * release index
 * release metadata
 * coreos-assembler builds

## Stream metadata

This document contains details about latest available artifacts, on each stream.

 * URL: `https://builds.coreos.fedoraproject.org/streams/${stream}.json`
 * Usage: Primary entrypoint for users.  Documented at https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/getting-started/
   and e.g. consumed by the [getfedora.org download page](https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download/)
 * (TODO) stream metadata JSON schema
